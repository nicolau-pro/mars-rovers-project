# Mars Rover Project

For task details see: **Cambium - Technical Test (JavaScript).pdf**

## To run the build:

```
npm i
npm start
```

## To run the unit tests:

```
npm test
```

## Notes for evaluation:

The input files are in **src\CSV\movements.csv**: movements and plateau (to define the staring plateau dimensions)
This test was developed on the latest **Chrome for Windows** on a 1920x1080px screen.

Cross-browser functionality, accessibility, SEO, mobile-responsiveness features etc. were not considered at this moment.

## Possible improvements:

There could have been a lot more unit tests and many modules could have been made agnostic and public in a helpers file.

In the modules there could have been more verification about the accuracy of data input etc.
